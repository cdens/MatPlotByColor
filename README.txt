README file for MatPlotByColor

This function enables a user to plot a line on a 2D graph, colored by a third value. The general format is 
plotbycolor(x,y,z), where x,y, and z are arrays of the same length, and x/y determine the location and z determines the line color.

Optional input arguments define the axes to which the plot should be applied, the contours to use, colormap for the plot (colormap must have one more color than the number of contours assigned), and line width.

**Note- this function is incompatible with labelling the line in a MATLAB legend
